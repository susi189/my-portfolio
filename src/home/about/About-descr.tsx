        I enjoy building things from scratch, experimenting with new
        technologies, and creating user facing products. I am an experienced
        problem solver who believes that best solutions are achieved through
        cross-team collaboration. As a software developer I will use my can-do
        attitude and my skills to contribute to the success of your company.
